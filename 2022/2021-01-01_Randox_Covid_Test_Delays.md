# Summary
I missed a flight to India because randox failed to meet the 11:59 pm delivery time for a PCR test. We got our test results at 9:50 am and 10:20 am respectively, which was too late. We phoned Randox when lines opened at 10 am and were told that they would not issue a refund because they do not guarantee the delivery times.

# 2. Reckless Profiteering by Randox
Randox is helping out lots of people by providing covid tests which enable travel. In London for example they introduced a series of **home testing products which are super useful**. Nonetheless I am writing to point out what I consider **unethical business practices** at Dublin Airport around the New Year period 2022.

### **a. Reckless Overbooking**
Essentially Randox booked more tests than they are capable of honouring within their stated deadlines. This is probably exacerbated by Seasonal travel and spikes in covid test rates. However, even if getting overrun is excusable Randox should stop excess bookings and communicate delay information to customers.

Why is this a problem?
* Lots of people dependant on PCR tests have missed flights: [see above](#list-of-people-affected)
* Randox **continues to accept "Next Day" bookings without warning customers** about the delays.
* Randox **Website and Social Media should confirm delays** and give ETA times to help customers.
* Randox should **email affected customers** to warn them that there are delays
* Randox is **Refusing Refunds** and coping out with their *no guarantee* disclaimer.


### b. Appointment Times not being honoured
Randox doesn't seem to triage people according to booking time. Basically if you turn up and there is a long queue you can end up waiting in the rain for over 40 minutes.

# 3. Appendix
### Practical Tips
* **Look at reviews before booking**
    * [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=randox+dublin+airport)
    * In hindsight the reviews showed that Randox was overbooking capacity the day before too
* Test as early as you can
* Pay for the fastest test available
* Bring an umbrella
* Arrive early for testing

### Philosophical Notes
This is an example of misaligned profit incentives. Profit encourages Randox to provide the PCR service, but if they overbook or provide poor customer service there's **no recourse for customers** to counter this in the short term. Maybe there's a merger opportunity between Randox and Ryanair. Ideally Randox Founder and Managing Director Dr Peter FitzGerald would step in and resolve these issues on moral grounds even if it eats into some profits.

On one hand this is a classic case of a Movie Theatre Audience trying to exit a small door. It's fine most of the time but when there's a surge the door (capacity) isn't big enough. Randox shouldn't overbook, just like how Movie theatres shouldn't let in more people than the emergency exit capacity.
